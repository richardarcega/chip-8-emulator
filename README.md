# CHIP-8 Emulator

A CHIP-8 emulator designed to replicate the behavior of the CHIP-8 virtual machine.

The CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language and virtual machine architecture that was developed in the 1970s. It was primarily used for creating simple video games on early microcomputers.

A CHIP-8 emulator reads the CHIP-8 program's binary code, interprets its instructions, and emulates the behavior of the CHIP-8 hardware, including its display, input, and sound system. This allows users to play classic games and applications that were designed for the CHIP-8 environment on contemporary platforms.

Emulators offer a way to preserve and experience retro gaming, making it possible for enthusiasts to enjoy and study the history of early video games without needing the original hardware.
